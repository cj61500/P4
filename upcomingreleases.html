                    <h3>Release Date: Dec 3rd 2021</h3>
                    Collaborator of the year? A Ma Maniére is certainly making a strong case for that cause due to their impressive and consciously concepted projects with Nike, Jordan, and adidas in 2021. Acting as a sturdy bookend to their eventful 2021 is their Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG, officially revealed on their social channels and confirmed for a release on November 24th, 2021. It features a cream white upper with a plum-like shade accented by a reptile-textured Swoosh logo and ankle, completing a luxurious package that mirrors the quality of their Air Jordan 3 collaboration of earlier this year.

                    <h3>Release Date: Dec 9th 2021, $105</h3>
                    The tradition of overtly festive, questionably designed sweaters will undoubtedly continue in 2021, and this year the Air Jordan 1 Mid is looking to join in on the fun. The ubiquitous silhouette has appeared in kids-exclusive sizing, complete with a holiday-friendly red, green, white and black colorway, but with a decorative boost that harkens back to a playful custom that has been synonymous with Christmas for decades.
                    The Air Jordan 1 Mid “Ugly Christmas Sweater” features a patterned knit on the mid-panel and ankle featuring basketballs (that look like snowflakes) and Michael Jordan’s 23 jersey number. Hits of green connected each symbol, achieving a wreath-like aesthetic. The color choices on the ankle switches things around, but still centered around the unmistakeable Yule-tide look.

                    <h3>Release Date: Dec 11th 2021, $225</h3>
                    While initially believed to be part of the model’s 25th anniversary due to a handful of Jordan Brand athletes teasing pairs throughout 2020, the 21-year-old colorway has carved out the holiday season for itself. In-depth, in-hand reviews haven’t disclosed how close to the original shape the upcoming sneakers are, but the past couple of blockbuster Jordan 11 releases (save for the Adapt iteration) have displayed Team Jumpman’s commitment to Tinker Hatfield’s 26-year-old design. Unlike a Player-Exclusive pair gifted to Jayson Tatum last year, the forthcoming retro is set to don a suede across the profiles and tongue and not mesh. A darker grey takes over the patient leather mudguard, while sole units opt for a white midsole/icy blue outsole combination.

                <h2>Air Jordan 1 Patent Bred</h2>
                <h3>Release Date: Dec 25th 2021, $170</h3>
                The final release of Jordan Brand’s Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG releases of 2021 is none other than this black/varsity red concoction charmingly dubbed the “Patent Bred”. Sharing the exact same color-blocking as the original pair whose infamy led to global recognition, this Air Jordan 1 is clearly looking to tug on the heartstrings of Air Jordan fans worldwide while adding a modern and flashy patent leather. As it is officially called the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG “Reimagined”, it’s clear that the new-meets-old direction is poised to add to the legacy of this timeless colorway.
